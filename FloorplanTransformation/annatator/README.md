## Getting started
Please first change the *loadFilenames()* function to specify the path of the floorplan image you want to annotate and the path to save annotation.

Please run the following command to start the annotator:
```bash
qlua main.lua
```

To see full debugging outputs, please run
```bash
qlua -lenv main.lua
```

Please see intruction.pdf for the usage of the annotator.
